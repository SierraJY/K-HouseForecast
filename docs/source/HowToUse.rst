Korean Real Estate Prediction Model User Guide
----------------------------------------------

This user guide provides instructions on how to use the Korean real estate prediction model developed using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and LightGBM.

.. note::
    Prerequisites
    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
    Required libraries installation: Pandas, Numpy, LightGBM, etc.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pandas numpy lightgbm

File Structure
--------------

1.Real_Estate_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the main code and the implemented prediction model.

2.dataset.csv: Dataset file used for model training and testing.

Usage Instructions
------------------

1. Environment Setup

    * Confirm the installation of Python and required libraries.
    * Open Jupyter Notebook and run the Real_Estate_Prediction.ipynb file.

2. Data Loading

    * Load the data from the 'dataset.csv' file within the code to inspect and preprocess the data.

3. Model Training

    * Train the model using LightGBM.
    * Adjust model hyperparameters in the code if desired.

4. Model Prediction

    * Apply the model to test data or new data for predictions.

5. Results Inspection

    * Visualize and analyze the performance and prediction results of the model.

6. Conclusion

    * Once the tasks are completed, run all cells and save the results.

.. note::
    If warnings or errors occur during code execution, review the messages and resolve any issues.
    Consider data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, or other enhancements for model performance.
